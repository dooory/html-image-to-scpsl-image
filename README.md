4 - Once extracted open the program that you downloaded (Imagemaker.exe) and then the converted html code should be copied to your clipboard.  

5 - Select a line in your doors.txt file using a text editing programme such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download); each line represents a different door status ([Link to reference for door statuses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/northwood-studios/SCPSL-Translations/master/Translations/English%20(default)/Doors.txt))

6 - Once picked paste the code that you got from the Imagemaker.exe onto the line that you picked in the doors.txt file, the image should be displayed when this door is in the state that you picked the image to be shown on.
